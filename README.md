In this repository, youâ€™ll find materials used in a live session at the Seville .NET user group, **SevillaDotNet**. This content includes **slides and examples** designed to help developers understand and apply various development techniques.

Among the available resources, two key examples stand out, demonstrating how to create an **MCP** client and server with all essential features, including:
* Tools
* Resources
* Prompts
